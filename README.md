# Cyber-Nano-GPT

A domain-specific Large Language Model built from scratch to analyze cybersecurity logs.

## Project Goal
Unlike general-purpose API wrappers, this project implements a custom Transformer architecture from the ground up. The goal is to engineer a lightweight, high-efficiency inference engine ("Nano") capable of parsing raw system logs and generating incident reports with low latency, bypassing the need for cloud-based dependencies.
